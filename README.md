### Data Updates  

Data displayed on the National Broadband Map site are as of June 30, 2014 and are no longer being updated. The Commission sought funding for FY 2016 to maintain and update the National Broadband Map, but this request was not granted.  

While the Commission is not currently in a position to update the map in light of funding constraints, it continues to collect and report on deployment through its [semi-annual Form 477 data collection](https://www.fcc.gov/general/form-477-resources-filers) and annual [Broadband Progress Report](https://www.fcc.gov/reports-research/reports/broadband-progress-reports).  

Beginning with data as of December 2014, data are available for [download on the FCC website](https://www.fcc.gov/general/broadband-deployment-data-fcc-form-477). Future rounds of data will also be posted at the same link.
